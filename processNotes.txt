Process Notes
======================
After learning about web servers and application frameworks, I'm fascinated by just how many different ways
there are to make web servers in node, such as using the express framework, basic node web server, etc.

Althought there are quite a few  ways to implement a web server, the following study will involve using 
express but also a few other ways as well which I will add to this repository as time progresses in their own
respective branches.

If you are unfamiliar with Node, web servers, or NPM, check out my handy guide to server side web development
called Backend_Programming_Recipes for extra details.




Basic web server
======================
For the basic web server, we'll use the basic example node provides on thier about page: https://nodejs.org/en/about/.


STEP 1: Create an application folder

STEP 2: Create a package.json folder with "npm init"
    o   Follow the details and fill them as you see fit.

STEP 3: Add an index.js file and insert basic html server example code in there.

STEP 4: In bash, run "node index.js" to run the server.

STEP 5: To see your program, go to your web browser and type in "localhost:3000"
    o   Note that "3000" is specified in your index.js file.
    o   You should see "Hello world"!.
